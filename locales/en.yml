    presentation: Kassiopé is a non-lucrative association aimed at offering free eye care to the most disabled. It was created in June of 2015 by a group of six french students, all of whom study at the Lycée International of Saint Germain en Laye.
    target: Its primary goal is to unearth diabetic retinopathy in regions lacking with eye doctors, as in France the number of ophthalmologists has immensely decreased in the past few years. However, supported by batch of three new members we have decided to export our project outside of France. Two of us, having already been to India, imagined our project in Ahmedabad where we would offer free eye tests and glasses to the people of the slums, particularly to the people related to Manav Sadhna. Two of us have already taught in one of the schools near the Gandhi Ashram and wish for our first eye tests to be in these types of schools where reading facilities are most needed. We hope to bolster our project to the entire slum but our eye tests can only expand as far as our stocks of glasses will increase. Kassiopé is associated to two companies (LeVisologiste and MXOphtalmic) who can offer cheap(er) equipment, supervise our projects and most importantly, make us look credible and trustworthy to future professional partners.
